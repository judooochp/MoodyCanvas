Jan 2018  

A simple surface plate asset manager and modified Moody Method procedure,  
  based on T.O. 33K6-4-137-1: Surface Plates (Autocollimator Method).  
Intended for internal use by technicians for verifications and external  
  use by customers to view their plates' histories.  

Add/browse customers and plates.  
Verify plates' flatness and view their results as a wireframe or as  
  a map of elevations relative to the center point.  

Improvements to be made:  
- Prevent duplicate entries to database for customers, plates (done, needs testing)  
- Build sample database  
- Reformat Canvas Header/Footer  
- Login  
- Customer control  
- Testing and bug fixing (in process)  
- Procedural reference  
- /static/ implementation of CSS and JavaScript  
- Aesthetic design improvements  
- Template standardization  
- Lightbox warnings  
- Making live on a VPS server (done, http://138.197.70.142)  
- Addition of Planekator procedure/app  
- Make useful for mobile interfaces  
- Improved workflow control  
- Allow for date to be set by user in case of no internet at time of verification
